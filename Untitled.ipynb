The 5 price data variables are all closely linked together, and only the adjusted close price reflects additional events like divident payouts or stock splits. Therefore, we only consider the adjusted close price (now referred to as \"price\") and the volume for our models. \n",

We can use the price/volume data of multiple stocks to predict the price/volume data of those multiple stocks to make use of the information hidden in the dependence of the development in those different assets. The problem is, that we have indeed a long timerange of past data, but we do not know anything about future prices (yet). Therefore, we need to split the past data into small sections and consider the earlier part of that section as the past data and the later part as the future. Therefore we can create many training sets of past/future data combinations to use for our training."

    "When we check the data, we encounter one problem: We do not have price and volume data available for arbitrary dates for each asset. For weekends and holidays, there is usually no trading occuring on stock exchanges and therefore no price is determined. These dates without price data vary between different assets, depending on which exchanges they are listed and in which jurisdiction the exchanges are located. For some assets, like Bitcoin, there is nevertheless price data available for all days because there is less regulation about the exchanges and the cryptocurrencies can be easily traded completly digital. Additionally, there is no price data available before the asset was available. In the case of a publicly traded company, this is usually the IPO.\n",

    "- Fill the missing prices with the average price of the days before and after\n",
